Be someone that other people want to be around.</p><p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Be respectful and constructive.</span> We’re a very diverse group (95 countries and counting!), so we’re not going to agree all the time. Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to your fellow GDG’ers. Don’t get into flamewars, don’t make personal attacks, don’t vent or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a potential flamewar or negative thread as early as possible.</p><p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Be collaborative.</span> Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, update the wiki, help each other out.</p><p><span style='font-weight: bold;'>Participate.</span> This is YOUR community, so be a part of it! Join in on discussions, show up for in-person meetings regularly, offer feedback, and offer to help implement that feedback!</p>",
