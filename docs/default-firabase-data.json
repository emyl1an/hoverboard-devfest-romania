We'll go into the details of our tried and tested approach to creating apps, from how data gets loaded and persisted to how it's prepared for the UI and how layouts are built, with a focus on how everything fits together. Motivation: Many developers have been focusing on getting things done quickly and with no regards to long-term maintenance and developing architectures that stand the test of time. However, there are ways in which apps can be built quickly, yet still have a solid architecture that's versatile and allows new features to be easily added. In our company, we've worked on a multitude of projects, from very small ones to huge ones that we're still maintaining years later and, in time, we've tested various architectures, patterns and frameworks. The goal of the presentation is to share our experiences and give details on the approach we've had best results with so far.",
